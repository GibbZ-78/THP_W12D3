## THP W12D3 - Developer track - Javascript: sorting & algorithms' complexity... I'm loving it!

### :one: Content :scroll:

After (re)learning the different sorting algorithms (bubble, select, insert, quick), here is another one : the merge or fusion sort!
In addition to this additional sorting exercise, you'll find a few others based on 2 subjects:

- Subject #1:

- Subject #2:

Here below are the resulting questions:

- Exercise 1  
  Solve topic 1 with an algorithmic complexity of O(n²), i.e. your program will have to compare each element with each other using 2 nested loops.
- Exercise 2  
  Solve topic 2 with an algorithmic complexity of O(n²), i.e. your program will have to compare each element with each other using 2 nested loops.
- Exercise 3
  Solve topic 1 with an algorithmic complexity of O(n), i.e. your program will be able to iterate over each element of the array multiple times (but no nested loop!).
- Exercise 4
  Solve topic 2 with an algorithmic complexity of O(n), i.e. your program will be able to iterate over each element of the array multiple times (but no nested loop!).
- Exercise 5
  Solve topic 1 by making only one passage on your list.  
  If you succeed in this exercise, know that it has been asked for an interview by Google. You can apply to Google. Class, right?
- Exercise 6  
  Solve topic 2 by making only one passage on your list.  
  If you succeed in this exercise, know that it was asked in interview by Mailchimp. You can apply to Mailchimp. Class, right?

### :two: How to :bulb:

1. Create an empty directory on your :computer:
2. Clone the current :octocat: repository to the latter via `git clone .`
3. If in a "change mood", replace the content of "numbers.txt" with a random list of - positive and negative - numbers of your choice
4. Launch the "mergesort.js" file thanks to a `node mergesort.js list.txt` command.
5. Run the "algoexo.js" file via `node algoexo.js list.txt`

### :three: Missing features / Possible evolution :rocket:

- Finalize / Improve quick sort wjicj does not work properly.
- Optimize all sorting algorithm by taking into account the numbers' distribution, etc.
- ...
